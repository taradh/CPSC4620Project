Library Management system with MySQL database and BoostrapJS front-end


We're using an AWS RDS database so we can connect to it anywhere. In order to connect to it you have have MySQL downloaded on your computer so you can run from the command line or you use MySQL shell or the SoC has MySQL on their machine so if you connect to it you can use their terminal to connect to the RDS. 

Here's how you connect to it via command line:

1. $> mysql -h database-1-4620.c9fxeyiderap.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u admin -p
2. You'll be prompted to enter the password
    $> Enter password: database
3. You're connected. All tables, primary keys and foreign keys have been added.
